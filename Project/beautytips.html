	<li>Tips :<br>	1. Eliminate Tired Puffy Eyes With Chilled Tea Bags
Natural Beauty Tips For Tired Puffy Eyes
Briefly steep 2 green, black, or chamomile tea bags in hot water for less than a minute. Then remove the tea bags from the water and chill in a small bowl in the refrigerator. Once chilled, place 1 bag over each closed eyelid. Leave on your lids for 5 to 15 minutes. Watch this video if you’d like to see me explain this.<br><br>

2. Use Raspberries And Coconut Oil For Brighter Lips
Natural Beauty Tips For Brighter Lips
In a small saucepan on low heat, warm 1 Tablespoon coconut oil until it liquefies. Remove from heat and add 4 fresh or frozen red raspberries. Mash berries and blend until smooth. Place in a small glass container and refrigerate until firm. Use clean fingers or a lipgloss brush to smooth over lips. Make this fresh every few days.<br><br>

3. Get A Natural Face Lift With Simple Yoga Poses
Natural Beauty Tips For A Natural Lift And Vitality
Doing inverted postures before pictures, interviews, and meetings can improve circulation and help give your face some extra lift and vitality. You perform the “downward dog” yoga pose by getting on the floor on your hands and knees and then straightening your legs. Or, simply bend forward and reach towards your toes. Stay in one of these positions as long as you feel comfortable, for about 1 to 5 minutes. If you have physical limitations such as injuries or back pain, check with your healthcare provider about how to modify this posture. Here are 7 different poses you can do for glowing skin.<br><br>

4. Get Soft, Kissable Skin With A Natural Pomegranate, Raspberry, and Sweet Almond Oil Blend
Natural Beauty Tips To Turn Dry Skin Into Luminous Soft Skin
Naturally hydrate dry skin and add an extra glow to the end of your skincare routine by creating a natural antioxidant-rich oil blend. Apply after cleansing or after putting on makeup. Mix together equal parts Pomegranate seed oil, Raspberry seed oil, and Sweet Almond Oil, or get the already made The Spa Dr. Glow Boost.<br>

Place 3 to 6 drops of the oil mixture in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together to warm the oils. Then, with your fingertips gently press the warm oil into dry areas of your face or areas where you have fine lines and wrinkles.<br><br>

5. Reduce Skin Creases By Changing Your Pillowcase
Natural Beauty Tips To Reduce Skin Creases
Instead of coarser fabrics, choose a pillowcase that is soft and silky to decrease the friction and skin compression that occurs while you sleep and leaves you with extra lines in the morning. If you sleep on your side, try switching sides occasionally or sleeping on your back, so your face doesn’t wrinkle over time from pressure in certain areas. But, don’t stress about this… ultimately, you want to be comfortable because high-quality sleep is essential for natural beauty. Here are some other beauty sleep tips from my friend Kathy Smith.<br><br>



6. Hydrate Dry Skin With Coconut Water
Natural Beauty Tips To Hydrate Dry Skin
Start your morning with a glass of fresh unsweetened coconut water. And, throughout the day, drink filtered water. At meals include skin-hydrating foods such as wild salmon, avocado, olives, and coconut.<br><br>

7. Prevent Sun Damaged Skin By Eating Wild Salmon
Natural Beauty Tips For Glowing Skin And To Prevent Sun Damage
Astaxanthin is a potent antioxidant that helps protect skin from the harmful effects of UVA sun damage, acting almost like an internal sunblock. It’s found in seafood such as salmon, krill, shrimp, lobster, crabs, and crayfish. You can also get astaxanthin through supplements.<br><br>

Enjoy several servings per week of wild salmon and seafood and consider taking a supplement every day, especially during sunny times of the year. You also want to protect your skin on the outside with a natural sun protector.<br><br>

8. Remove Dead Skin And Revitalize Your Face With An Organic Papaya Mask
Natural Beauty Tips To Remove Dead Skin
Many exfoliants contain abrasive ingredients that scratch your skin, which may damage the skin and speed signs of aging. Instead, it’s better to use an enzymatic exfoliant. Papaya contains the natural enzyme papain, and pineapple contains the enzyme bromelain, which helps naturally exfoliate the skin to leave it smooth and soft. Greener (unripe) papayas have higher amounts of papain, so opt for these to get the best benefit. If you have sensitive skin, use ripe papayas as they are less likely to trigger an inflammatory reaction.

Scoop out a ¼ cup raw papaya flesh and mash or blend with 1 Tablespoon fresh pineapple until smooth. Apply to dry skin and leave on for 5 to 15 minutes. Then rinse with cool water. If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test on your arm before applying to face.

The alpha hydroxy acids and the enzymes in this recipe dissolve dry, dead skin. You only need to do this once or twice per week.<br><br>

9. Turn Mineral Makeup Powder Into A Natural Sunblock
Natural Beauty Tips To Create A Natural Beauty Sunblock
Use tinted mineral sunblock instead of foundation or mix your favorite mineral makeup powder with a sunblock like this one for a natural makeup that is light and protects your skin from the sun’s damaging effects. Mineral-based (zinc oxide) sunblocks sometimes appear white and pasty so adding a mineral makeup tint helps your skin look glowing and smooth. Watch this video tutorial to see how.<br><br>

10. Hydrate And Nourish Lips With Shea Butter
Natural Beauty Tips That Hydrate And Nourish Lips
Traditional chapsticks contain petrolatum, mineral oil, and hormone-disrupting oxybenzone. Replace these with nourishing natural ingredients such as shea butter (or cocoa butter) and coconut oil. Make your own lip salve using equal parts of these ingredients or follow my friend Katie’s (Wellness Mama) DIY recipe here.<br><br>

11. Get Clear Radiant Skin By Cutting Sugar Out
Natural Beauty Tips For Clear Radiant Skin
Sugar is the biggest contributor to inflammation that shows up on the skin as acne, dry itchy skin, and wrinkles. Try cutting sugar from your diet for 10 days, especially if you have an important day coming up and want to look your best.<br><br>

12. Reduce Fine Lines And Wrinkles With Bone Broth
Natural Beauty Tips To Reduce Fine Lines And Wrinkles
Collagen helps give our skin its tone and is crucial for reducing fine lines and wrinkles. Since production naturally depletes as we age, consider taking a high-quality collagen supplement from a clean source. Bone broth and gelatin contain collagen, and vitamin C helps with collagen production. My colleague Dr. KellyAnn Petrucci loves bone broth and she shares how it can make you look younger.<br><br>



13. Cleanse Your Skin With Almond Oil
Natural Beauty Tips To Cleanse Your Skin
Switch from bar to liquid soap that doesn’t lather. Instead of stripping your skin with foamy cleansers, nourish your skin while you cleanse for a healthy clean glow. You can use oils such as argan and almond oil to cleanse the skin naturally or use a natural cleanser. You can learn more about cleansing in this video.<br><br>

14. Stop Dark Circles Under Your Eyes With Arnica
Natural Beauty Tips That Stop Dark Under Eye Circles
If you have chronic under eye circles, you may have “allergic shiners” which indicate a food or environmental allergy. Try to identify any possible allergens and avoid them for 10 days to see if you notice a difference. If you wake up with an occasional darkness under your eyes then try using arnica gel or skin care products containing arnica. Arnica has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that alleviate swelling and reduce the appearance of dark under eye circles.<br><br>

15. Improve Your Complexion With Ylang Ylang Oil
Natural Beauty Tips That Improve Complexion
Skip synthetic fragrances containing harmful ingredients such as phthalates. Instead, use natural fragrances in the form of pure essential oils such as ylang ylang.

In addition to having a lovely smell, Ylang Ylang Flower Oil helps balance sebum levels for both dry and oily complexions. And, it has a soothing and smoothing effect. Just add a few drops to your favorite oil blend. It’s also one of the essential oils in my favorite skin care. Here’s a great resource for more about harmful ingredients in skin care.<br><br>

16. Turn Stress Into Bliss For Clear Beautiful Skin
Natural Beauty Tips For Clear Naturally Beautiful Skin
Skin issues such as premature aging, acne, eczema, rosacea, and vitiligo are worsened by chronic stress and upset. Sleep, meditation, exercise and touch are some important ways to relieve stress so you can have glowing skin, naturally. A good night’s sleep gives time for our skin to rejuvenate. Meditation and moderate exercise are known to help us manage stress. And, touch causes the release of hormones that make us feel happy and connected. If you need help here are some places for tips on sleep, meditation, and exercise.<br><br>

17. Prevent Sunburns, Sun Damage And Uneven Skin Tone With Green Algae
Natural Beauty Tips To Prevent Sun Damage And Uneven Skin Tone
Sun protection is essential for healthy skin and natural beauty. While some sun may give you a sun-kissed glow, we know that too much damages your skin and predisposes you to premature aging, uneven skin tone, and other chronic diseases. My favorite sunblocks contain zinc oxide instead of harmful chemical sunscreens that have been linked to hormone disrupting effects. Here is one of my favorites.<br><br>

Also, you can nourish and protect your skin from the sun’s damaging effects by using skincare with natural ingredients such as chlorella and resveratrol. Due to its high levels of chlorophyll, Chlorella Vulgaris (Green Algae) Extract, helps shields the body from UV radiation.<br>

Also, Resveratrol has potent antioxidant effects on the skin. Because cell damage is at the root of most aging disorders, protecting the skin from free-radical activity is a significant preventative measure for healthy skin.<br><br>

18. Get Natural Glowing Skin With Micronutrients
Natural Beauty Tips For Natural Glowing Skin
Your skin needs certain micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) for speedy skin repair and turnover. Zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin C are some of the important nutrients to get from food or in the form of a supplement to help ensure your skin remains healthy, especially if you have chronic skin issues such as acne, eczema and premature aging.<br><br>

19. Use Aloe Vera To Transform Red Irritated Skin Into Soft Healthly Skin
Natural Beauty Tips For Soft Healthy Skin

If your skin is red and irritated, you’ll want to soothe it right away. Prolonged inflammation of your skin can cause your skin to break down collagen. Or, if you just want smooth, vibrant skin, you can also use this skin soother. Aloe Vera gel has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and healing properties, and it penetrates the skin easily to provide nourishment.

It’s terrific for soothing skin that’s been overexposed to the sun, as well as for treating minor cuts and scrapes, eczema, and acne. In most stores, the aloe you’ll find contains preservatives, fillers, and artificial ingredients. Look for pure aloe from your local health food store, or buy an aloe plant and simply slice open a leaf, extracting and saving the gel. The Spa Dr.’s Daily Essentials contains aloe, as well.<br><br>



20. Super Moisturize Skin Naturally With Hyaluronic Acid
Natural Beauty Tips To Super Moisturize Skin Naturally
When we travel, are stressed, or experience extreme weather conditions, our skin can appear shriveled and dull. And, as we age, our skin becomes less resistant and may appear unhealthy. Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic acid) is a wonderful hydrophilic ingredient, which means it readily binds to water and gives super moisturizing properties.

Hyaluronic acid is found throughout the body, but it especially concentrated on the skin. Because of its high water-binding capacity, it acts as a hydrating agent and space filler. It supports collagen and elastin, by keeping them nourished and moist, reduces the appearance of wrinkles while keeping the skin soft, smooth and supple. You can find Hyaluronic acid in some natural skin care products.<br><br>

21. Get An Instant, Youthful Skin Lift Using Antioxidant-Rich Natural Actives
Natural Beauty Tips For An Instant Youthful Skin Lift
Avoid the neurotoxin Botox and other more invasive procedures and look to nature instead. Antioxidant-rich and hydrating natural actives can lift and protect the skin naturally. And, one of the ingredients in quality organic skin care serums is Pullulan, which has an instant lifting effect, naturally! It is a polysaccharide produced from starch by cultivating the yeast, Aureobasidiumpullulans. It provides an antioxidant effect as well as an instant lifting effect that helps improve the overall texture and appearance of the skin. Long-term use of Pullulan will help strengthen the integrity of the skin.<br><br>

22. Brighten Dull Skin Using Green Tea As A Toner
Natural Beauty Tips That Brighten Dull Skin
White and green teas applied topically on the skin have anti-inflammatory, brightening, evening, cleansing and hydrating properties. They’re ideal for using as a skin brightening tea toner. You can make a tea toner with one or both of these teas by steeping the teas for 5 minutes, allowing them to cool to room temperature. Then, either pat onto your face, apply with cotton pads or pour into a spray bottle and spritz onto clean skin. <br><br>

23. Eliminate Pimples For Clear Skin With Tea Tree Oil
Natural Beauty Tips To Eliminate Pimples For Clear Skin
Tea tree oil is well-known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, and research shows it can help reduce mild to moderate acne breakouts. Be sure to use diluted tree oil because the undiluted variety can burn and irritate skin when applied directly. Just add 1 to 2 drops to a single application of your cleanser, serum or moisturizer. You want about a 5% dilution, which means 5 drops of tea tree oil per 1 teaspoon of carrier oil or cream. You can apply this 2 – 3 times daily.<br><br>

24. Use Chamomile Tea Ice Cubes To Freshen Up Tired Looking Skin
Natural Beauty Tips That Freshen Up Tired Skin
Brew a strong pot of chamomile tea (about 1.5 cups water with 1 teabag), allow to cool 10 minutes or more and then pour into ice tray and place in freezer. Once frozen, wrap the tea cube in a thin cloth or washcloth and apply to pimples, puffy under eye skin, sun-kissed skin, or irritated skin for a quick skin toner pick up. You only need to apply for a few seconds to a minute per area.<br><br>

25. Clean Facial Pores With Honey, Turmeric, And Yogurt For A Smoother Complexion
Natural Beauty Tips To Clean Skin Pores
Combine the healing, clarifying, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial effects of honey with pore cleansing and sebum balancing effects of turmeric and pH enhancing and lactic acid effects of yogurt into this pore cleanser… Mix together 1 Tablespoon plain yogurt, 1 Tablespoon raw honey and 1 teaspoon turmeric powder into a paste. Apply to face and neck and leave for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then wash with cool water, pat your skin dry and apply your favorite serum and moisturizer.<br><br>

26. Make A Natural Beauty Mask To Restore And Hydrate Tired Dull Skin
Natural Beauty Tips To Restore And Hydrate Tired Dull Skin
Oats have moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties. Avocado is hydrating and nourishing, with naturally occurring vitamins A and E. And, Yogurt contains nutrients, enzymes and active cultures that help reduce inflammation and balance the pH of your skin for a healthy skin microbiome. In a bowl, blend together 1/4 cup oat flour (ground uncooked oats), 2 Tablespoons unsweetened yogurt and ¼ of an avocado. Mix well and then apply enough to cover your clean, dry face. Leave on face for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove with warm, wet washcloth, and then rinse face with water and pat dry. Use the mask once per day as needed.<br>
